# Smart-Elevator-System
This is an IoT based application to monitor elevator and to inform technicians or other concerned authorities regarding any malfunctioning. In this way, any emergency can be responded to promptly.


The random function for each sensor present on the elevator is defined in the python program. Readings generated by these random functions are sent to the Thingspeak IoT platform.

A sample program for generating and uploading the data is in the repository.

Using the mobile application technician or any other concerned authority can monitor the real-time status of the elevator, will receive notification for any malfunctioning and upcoming maintenance schedule. To assist technicians to reach the elevator fastely, there is a map in the application having the location of elevators.
